To use the translator, simply react in the message you want to translate with the flag_emoji of the language you want to be translated to.

**Process**

-   Right click on the message
-   Select the option to `Add Reaction`
-   Go the standard "Flags" section _(the last section)_
-   If you want to translate the message to spanish _(for example)_ simply react with the :flag_es: emoji.

You will receive a reply with the translated message to the destined language

We use the [DeepL API](https://www.deepl.com/docs-api/translate-text) to translate messages.
